# Replacing the App Icon with AppIconPreview

Use the **AppIconPreview** view in `ContentView.swift` to generate an icon that matches the app’s Plan tab (basket + dollar on gray). Then use that image as the app icon.

## 1. Open the preview

1. In Xcode, open **ContentView.swift**.
2. Show the Canvas (Editor → Canvas, or **⌥⌘↩**).
3. In the preview selector at the bottom, choose **"App Icon"** (the preview that shows `AppIconPreview()`).

You’ll see a 1024×1024 gray (#808080) square with the basket + dollar icon centered.

## 2. Export a 1024×1024 PNG

**Option A – Xcode Canvas**

1. In the Canvas, right‑click the **App Icon** preview.
2. If available, use **Export** (or **Save as Image**) and save as PNG at 1024×1024.
3. If your Xcode version doesn’t export at exact size, use Option B.

**Option B – Simulator screenshot**

1. Run the app in the **Simulator**.
2. In code, temporarily make the root view `AppIconPreview()` (e.g. in `PantrySnapApp`, show `AppIconPreview()` instead of `ContentView()`).
3. Run, then take a screenshot (**⌘S**). Crop to the 1024×1024 area (or design the preview so the canvas is exactly 1024×1024 and the window is not scaled).
4. Restore the root view to `ContentView()`.

**Option C – External tool**

1. Use a SwiftUI preview or a small test app that presents `AppIconPreview()` in a 1024×1024 window.
2. Use a screenshot or screen‑capture tool that can export at 1:1 (e.g. 1024×1024 pixels).
3. Save as PNG.

## 3. Update Assets.xcassets

1. In the Project Navigator, open **Assets.xcassets** → **AppIcon**.
2. For the **1024×1024** slot (iOS Universal and/or any 1024pt slot in your `Contents.json`):
   - Drag in your exported PNG, or
   - Click the slot and choose the file.
3. If you have separate slots for light/dark/tinted, repeat for each 1024×1024 variant you use.
4. Build and run; the new icon should appear on the home screen and in the Simulator after reinstalling or clearing the app icon cache.

## Notes

- **AppIconPreview** uses the same **PlanIconContent** layout as the Plan tab (basket + dollar), so the home screen icon matches in‑app branding.
- Background is **#808080**. Icon is black so it stays visible on gray; adjust `foregroundStyle` in `AppIconPreview` if you want a different color.
- iOS expects a single 1024×1024 PNG for the main app icon; other sizes are often generated by Xcode from that asset.
